The main idea of music genre segregation is to classify a piece of music contained in
an audio file into a particular genre based on its frequency (Mel frequency cepstral coefficient).
It uses some mathematical concepts of discrete cosine transformation and linear cosine
transformation internally for processing data and removing noise contained in it. The 10 most
popular music genres are: blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae,
and rock. The algorithms that can be applied are multi-class support vector machines, K-means
clustering, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The
algorithm with the highest accuracy is chosen as the final algorithm for music genre separation.
And the model will be trained on the GTZAN dataset, which consists of western music genres.
